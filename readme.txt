./AGZ/Log Files/BarometricPressure.csv
This file contains data from the on-board barometric pressure sensor:
1: Timestemp, 2: Pressure, 3: Altitude, 4: Temperature

./AGZ/Log Files/GroundTruthAGL.csv
1: imgid (id of the MAV image), 2: x_gt (ground truth camera position x), 3: y_gt (ground truth camera position y), 4: z_gt (ground truth camera position z), 5: omega_gt (degrees, ground truth camera orientation yaw), 6: phi_gt (degrees, ground truth camera orientation pith), 7: kappa_gt (degrees, ground truth camera orientation roll), 8: x_gps (GPS camera position x), 9: y_gps (GPS camera position y), 10: z_gps (GPS camera position z)
All values regarding positions are in the WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N coordinate system use plotPath.m to visualize the data in matlab

./AGZ/Log Files/GroundTruthAGM
